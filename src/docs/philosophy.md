### Back story 

Whenever creating an optimization we are optimizing for a given end. In best case, what we are optimizing for is explicitly defined. But, more often than not "optimize" is implicitly defined and at worst just a fancy word. Why is this relevant to code, because every framework, library package, code paradigm, boiler plate etc is fundamentally an optimization. That is, taking a large solution set and for a given end applying a model or a set of premises to the system. The result of the application of the model is an optimization. Now enough of that. 

The objective of this project is to optimize styling for design systems or theming. Why is this a worthy pursuit? We all know the internet iterates at a ridiculously fast pace and keeping up with trends can take a lot of resources. But keeping up with the perception that your business is modern is necessary because it is part of a business's competitive advantage mix. There are other arguments to be made as to why maintaining modern design trends is a visual and intuitive marker for customers of a healthy business.


At this point it is necessary to define what we expect from a design system. A design system facilitates production of digital assets by strict definitions of; 
- brand 
  - color 
  - typography 
  - imagery 
  - illustration 
  - personality 

What follows from a clear brand position is a set of guiding principles that define the rest of an experience. I would like to make a very important callout the models for the relationship between esthetic and personality(brand) are generalizations and thus guidelines and must not be used without thought. The reason for this is simply that perception is cultural. For example, though currently percive round with organic, soft and welcoming and sharp with analytic, exacting and fastidious. This is by no means categorical and I am know that if I did a little history exploration I would find numerous exceptions to this rule. The point being that the rules of perception are meant to guide rather then rule and thus allow us to craft more meaningful experiences.
