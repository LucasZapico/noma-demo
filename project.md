SUMMER SEASON
July 9th – October 3rd

Usually during the summer months, we would be serving our vegetable season menu. Instead, this summer, we will reopen with a menu that celebrates the best of what we’ve offered these past two years. This also gives us the chance to work with, and support, as many people in our supply network as possible. So, alongside the best of what’s to offer from the plant kingdom, expect to find a piece of grilled seafood and perhaps a cut of meat on the menu during this period (we can of course accommodate dietary restrictions).

From autumn onwards we will return to our three distinct seasons, beginning with Game and Forest season.

GAME & FOREST SEASON
Dates to be announced

This is the only period of the year when meat will play a starring role at noma, and we will serve everything we can get our hands on: a teal for 2, a goose for 4, leg of moose, reindeer tongue, and wild duck (for those of you following us on Instagram, we will spare our friendly duck neighbours). The Game and Forest Season menu will also pay homage to everything that grows in the forest: berries, mushrooms, nuts, and all of the wild plants. It’s of course also the harvest season, so truly one of the most bountiful moments of the year. This season will be a celebration of autumnal abundance.
